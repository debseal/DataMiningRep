I could not see it doing anything.  I did know that the sound was coming from the ship.

So fast that it just left a streak.  When it left on two vectors.  First to the right slightly"," up and away for about an inch of streak"," then back slightly to the left and straight away at an upward angle out of the atmosphere I imagine leaving a big streak. I have no other evidence than this story.  I would certainly like to investigate that family who lived in the house the ufo was over.  This is the only written version of this event"," although I have told a handful of people over the years since it happened.  You can call me for a drawing if you want.  I&apos;m no artist but I can try.  Thanks for your interest.  Let me know if this experience is worth anything"," I would appreciate the kickback.  But don&apos;t get me wrong I am honest to God writing this as it happened to me"," and its certainly not for any other motivation other than to present the story to someone who will actually find it yet another piece of evidence to support that there really are ufos.

They approached from the north. They came directly towards me until at one point they were virtually overhead. They were all three flying in a very close formation in a line three abreast. They were just below cloud level. When they were almost directly above me you could make out the shape of them quite easily. They were completly silent with no visible sign of propulsion. No lights on them at all. They matched the over cast sky almost pefecly. They were in my sight for I would say about three to four minutes. One of the objects on the outside of the three then made a perfect right angle turn away from the other two objects. At that point they were lost from my view because of near by buildings.The exact year I saw the three objects over the town I was living in at the time was 1971. It as taken me all these years to talk about the sighting because at the time of the sightings I did not wish to make my sighting too public because I did not want certain types of people knocking on my door. Plus all those years ago there was no such thing as the internet where you could talk about these things to people and still reatain a certain amount of anonymity. So that is why I waited all these years to tell my story. At the time of my sighting I was interested in astronomy and was building my own 6&quot; Newtonian reflector telescope. So as you can appreciate at that time I used to spend quite a lot of time looking at the sky. On this particular evening I had just gone outside to put the milk bottles out for the milk man to collect the following day. The year was 1971 it was a Friday night but I have to be honest I&apos;m not sure now what month of the year it was. To carry on with the story as I was out side in the back garden of the house I happened to glance up at the sky. The night was fine and dry but the sky was very overcast with cloud. What I saw then I can hardly beleive I saw even today sometimes. What I saw were three objects heading in my direction. They were well below the level of the clouds and were very easily seen by the naked eye. The three objects were in a perfect formation three abreast. They were also very close together. Far closer to each other than coventional would fly under normal conditions. They approached me in complete silence until they were almost directly above my head. I would guess there speed"," but it is only a rough guess"," at no more than 15miles per hours if that. When the objects were almost overhead there shape could be easily defined without the aid of binoculars. I have yet to see after all these years of seeing pictures of UFO&apos;s still to see an object with the same shape as the three I saw. I would best describe it as Like a football cut exactly in half"," but with the bottom edge slightly rounded. Viewed from above or below as I saw the object it would appear perfectly round. The colour of the three objects was almost a perfect match with the night sky. I would describe the colour as a dull brownish grey. All three were perfectly silent with no visible signs of propulsion. Which would easily been seen from the distance they were from me by this time. There were no lights on them at all. They just seemed to be gliding across the night sky. Just before the objects went from my view because of the surrounding one of the objects made a perfect 90 degree turn away fro the other two. But unlike conventional aircraft it did not turn in a radius. One minute it was flying in a forward direction the in an instant it changed direction The other two objects continued to fly in a southerly. The objects had approached me from the north. The single obect I would say headed west. At that point I lost sight of the three objects over the roofs of the nearby houses. I mentioned my sighting to my work colleagues the very next day at work but I think they were a bit sceptical about what I had seen the previous night. I can&apos;t say I blame them. I think I would be too if someone told me about such a thing. Other than telling a few people at work at the time I did not make the sighting too public. I still tell peole about my sighting even today when I get into conversations about UFO&apos;s and the like. But I think they take what I tell them with a pinch of salt. All I would like to had to my story is the fact that in my oppinion the three object I saw that Friday night in 1971 were definitly not manufactured on this planet.""}"

I"," being an old pilot ","thought it was a drug drop but I could not account for the slanted beam and the object which seemed to defy gravity. There was only one light and no noise.""}"

Seemed to be just above tree line but it was huge so hard to tell how high. Silent. Slow. Many saw it. Police cars followed. was dark saw perimeter lights only. Truly Phenominal.There was commotion outside. I was at my boyfriends house I went out and Saw what everyone was looking at (Many people on the street were standing infront of their houses looking up) this craft was huge it had lights all around the perimeter Like a floating football field. And it made no sound.  It seemed to be following the street...which was a dead end so the police cars which came wizzing along had to turn around and go back the way they came when it glided on past.  There was talk about the sighting for a breif time but excuses were made that some jokers from west point were flying in formation. Also A blimp was mentioned I believe.  I know it was not the airforce flying in formation"," Because the lights were all connected. I could tell this because the distance between them remained fixed. Also what I saw was very low and made no sound. I am skeptical about the blimp explaination because It was not confirmed that there was infact a blimp hovering around after dark at that time...I would hope the police would know of such an event. But they didn&apos;t.  This was a long time ago but I recently saw a similar craft cought on video on T.V. Also some I witness accounts were Familiar From the lights to the slow speed to the lack of sound.  And this account came from a police officer I was hoping it was the same sighting I was wittness to but it wasn&apos;t. I have heard nothing else about the event.  I looked online to try and find some record. I thougt that maybe someone else would corroborate the event for me but I see no listings For Croton - On - Hudson.""}"

My mom was at the front door and window.  She was excited and claimed that there was a flying saucer outside.  Not wanting to be disturbed from watching a favorite TV show"," at the time"," I told mom to leave me alone.  Anyway"," she got my sister&apos;s attention first and they both still claimed that there was really a UFO outside.  I looked in thier direction and could see that there were flashing lights through the windows.  I told them that it probably was the police with somebody pulled over on the side of the highway.  We lived right off State Rt. 42 South"," just outside of Xenia"," Ohio.  My mom said that it wasn&apos;t the state police it was in the air.  I told here it may be a police helicopter or something like that.  Then I noticed how quite it was outside.  Usually traffic was relatively constant until about eleven o&apos;clock in the evening and it would die out to an occassional trickle.  The lack of sound is what first caught my interest.  My excplaination about the helicopter was shot down because of no sound.  That&apos;s when I got up to take a look.  I looked out the window and saw flashing lights that came from beyond my field of vision because of the front porch.  There wasn&apos;t any traffic and no sound"," but the lights were there. I went out onto the porch and immediately looked to my left towards Xenia.  There were some cars stopped on the road.  I then looked to the right and saw the same thing.  There weren&apos;t may cars but there were definately other witnesses.  This all happened in a couple of seconds.  I looked up and above and beyond the tree in the front yard over the median of the highway was a very large (as big as our house) dark shape with lights flashing all over it.  The lights were several colors: white"," red and green are the ones I remember most.  I can&apos;t quite remember the exact shape of the UFO but mom remembers it as an oval or cirular shape.  It remained stationary over the median for what seemed a minute or so"," it&apos;s really hard to say exactly how long it was ! there.  Then it started moving to my right straight down the median until it was at the next house or slightly beyond.  It started to come down closer to the ground and the underside started to glow brightly.  Then just when we thought it was going to land it arched off away from us.  Whatever it was it was fast.  It went from a fairly shape to a spot of light in what seemed to be just a split second.  It darted around in the sky for a few minutes zigzagging back and forth then it disappeared.  We didn&apos;t report it then because I personnally didn&apos;t want to be referred as a kook.  I wished that I can talk to others who saw the UFO that night.  It was reported in the news of multiple sightings then things died down.  Someday I think I would like to be hypnotised to see if I could recall things better"," like the exact day"," the exact shape"," etc
