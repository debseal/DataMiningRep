I could not see it doing anything.  I did know that the sound was coming from the ship.

So fast that it just left a streak.  When it left on two vectors.  First to the right slightly"," up and away for about an inch of streak"," then back slightly to the left and straight away at an upward angle out of the atmosphere I imagine leaving a big streak. I have no other evidence than this story.  I would certainly like to investigate that family who lived in the house the ufo was over.  This is the only written version of this event"," although I have told a handful of people over the years since it happened.  You can call me for a drawing if you want.  I&apos;m no artist but I can try.  Thanks for your interest.  Let me know if this experience is worth anything"," I would appreciate the kickback.  But don&apos;t get me wrong I am honest to God writing this as it happened to me"," and its certainly not for any other motivation other than to present the story to someone who will actually find it yet another piece of evidence to support that there really are ufos.

They approached from the north. They came directly towards me until at one point they were virtually overhead. They were all three flying in a very close formation in a line three abreast. They were just below cloud level. When they were almost directly above me you could make out the shape of them quite easily. They were completly silent with no visible sign of propulsion. No lights on them at all. They matched the over cast sky almost pefecly. They were in my sight for I would say about three to four minutes. One of the objects on the outside of the three then made a perfect right angle turn away from the other two objects. At that point they were lost from my view because of near by buildings.The exact year I saw the three objects over the town I was living in at the time was 1971. It as taken me all these years to talk about the sighting because at the time of the sightings I did not wish to make my sighting too public because I did not want certain types of people knocking on my door. Plus all those years ago there was no such thing as the internet where you could talk about these things to people and still reatain a certain amount of anonymity. So that is why I waited all these years to tell my story. At the time of my sighting I was interested in astronomy and was building my own 6&quot; Newtonian reflector telescope. So as you can appreciate at that time I used to spend quite a lot of time looking at the sky. On this particular evening I had just gone outside to put the milk bottles out for the milk man to collect the following day. The year was 1971 it was a Friday night but I have to be honest I&apos;m not sure now what month of the year it was. To carry on with the story as I was out side in the back garden of the house I happened to glance up at the sky. The night was fine and dry but the sky was very overcast with cloud. What I saw then I can hardly beleive I saw even today sometimes. What I saw were three objects heading in my direction. They were well below the level of the clouds and were very easily seen by the naked eye. The three objects were in a perfect formation three abreast. They were also very close together. Far closer to each other than coventional would fly under normal conditions. They approached me in complete silence until they were almost directly above my head. I would guess there speed"," but it is only a rough guess"," at no more than 15miles per hours if that. When the objects were almost overhead there shape could be easily defined without the aid of binoculars. I have yet to see after all these years of seeing pictures of UFO&apos;s still to see an object with the same shape as the three I saw. I would best describe it as Like a football cut exactly in half"," but with the bottom edge slightly rounded. Viewed from above or below as I saw the object it would appear perfectly round. The colour of the three objects was almost a perfect match with the night sky. I would describe the colour as a dull brownish grey. All three were perfectly silent with no visible signs of propulsion. Which would easily been seen from the distance they were from me by this time. There were no lights on them at all. They just seemed to be gliding across the night sky. Just before the objects went from my view because of the surrounding one of the objects made a perfect 90 degree turn away fro the other two. But unlike conventional aircraft it did not turn in a radius. One minute it was flying in a forward direction the in an instant it changed direction The other two objects continued to fly in a southerly. The objects had approached me from the north. The single obect I would say headed west. At that point I lost sight of the three objects over the roofs of the nearby houses. I mentioned my sighting to my work colleagues the very next day at work but I think they were a bit sceptical about what I had seen the previous night. I can&apos;t say I blame them. I think I would be too if someone told me about such a thing. Other than telling a few people at work at the time I did not make the sighting too public. I still tell peole about my sighting even today when I get into conversations about UFO&apos;s and the like. But I think they take what I tell them with a pinch of salt. All I would like to had to my story is the fact that in my oppinion the three object I saw that Friday night in 1971 were definitly not manufactured on this planet.""}"

Later"," I was in Army Intelligence as Chief"," Intelligence Branch"," Military Intelligence Division"," G2.  During the USS PUEBLO incident I participated in decisions about the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea (Jan68).  I experienced an intense Deja Vu and there was a sense of dread that &quot;the last time through&quot; we had made the wrong decision and used nukes vs NK.  I made recommendations not use them in a memo that had 5 items against and 3 items for their use. After the memo had b! een acce pted by"," sent in CINC"," UNC name unchanged"," I experienced a recall of craft seen at 4 years old and the feeling that was why had the &quot;contact.&quot;  That the purpose of that &quot;contact&quot; had been fulfilled with my recommending not using the nuke weapons but instead advocating for negotiations and setting an example for other countries to keep the peace.  The first point of the memo was the stated United Nations Command mission was to &quot;keep the peace.&quot; The second point was negotiated to get the crew back unharmed and set an example for other countries to follow in such crises. I can recall the entire memo but it was classified: TOP SECRET"," NOFORN"," LIMDIS"," EYES ONLY  on the rest of the items in the memo.  But there was the intense feeling that the purpose of the contact had been fulfilled with decision not to use nuclear weapons in response to the seizure of the USS PUEBLO.  I have only told a very few persons about this for obvious reasons.  But it is as clear to me today was it was then.  At the time my IQ was measured at 155 and I had a photographic memory with respect to reading intellligence reports.  The naming of the position I held as Chief"," Intelligence Branch identifies me to those who have access to the information of who filled that position during the PUEBLO crisis.  I am a bit uncomfortable about that but the experience of 1949 is clear in my mind.  I have researched for sightings of such an object as I saw: cigar shaped with double row of windows and light brown metallic color and huge:  as a 4 year old I can only try to guess at the true size of the object.  But I estimate at least 500 yard long (in my mind 5 football fields) or larger.  At one point I found a list of sightings in a book which indicated a large cigar shaped object in summer of 1949 near South Bend"," Indiana which is approx 30 miles from the New Troy"," Michigan location.

There was no sound at all"," only this intense light"," which shone so bright"," that it was impossible to tell the shape"," or see the craft itself...however it was directly over us..impossible to tell how close or the size. We could only see the light and here no sound. We ducked down behind the bushes"," which was a joke"," because they didn&apos;t hide us at all"," and I urged my husband to turn the light off...he did and the object/light withdrew from us and grew smaller and smaller until it was the same star-like ofject we had seen before. My husband turned the light on again and shined toward the &quot;star&quot; and once again it zoomed toward us and grew into this brilliant light overhead. Once more he turned the light off and it zoomed away...off into the distant horizon. We went into the house"," and turned off the lights....locking the doors..I called my mother to report on what had just happened. A few days later there was an article in the Lorain Journal or the Sandusky Register paper"," about 2 nurses who were leaving work and chased by a ufo on their route home. This was on the same night! The direction they were coming from would have been in the same direction this light came from. The milage from there to where we were would have been about 34-45 miles"," and if it was from the Cleveland Ohio area the distance from us was about 65-80 miles...if I remember correctly. So it traveled a long distance to reach us in seconds...and also what is interesting to take note of"," is that what kind of technology would it have to have to spy our flashlight at such a distance...and be able to zero in on it&apos;s location"," and be there in seconds....so we were open to the idea that maybe it was not from somewhere else but maybe some unknown craft of ours. My husband had a mathmatics degree and was a scientific person. so this is why he kept playing with the light to see what would happen"," and before the experience was not a believer in ufos. Prior to this event some weeks before this I had been alone at home and spotted hovering glowing objects over the woods late at night. The area where we lived was within a mile of a proposed neclear powerplant to be built by Ohio Edison. They purchased land without telling the truth to the people who sold to them. They thought it was going to be a resort. Later the truth came out. There was great oposition to it.The lights that I had seen were hovering over that area. One note of interest. This experience had an impact on me"," and I have always saught an explaination...a few years or so after this event"," I started having out of body experiences...once"," for some reason I became really still during one of these experiences and asked with my thoughts"," about the ufo experiences....and a voice answered me saying&quot;They are real"," they are related to us in that all energy is related"," and"," were in the area to influence the population who lived there"," to protest the building of the neclear power plant&quot;.

I was in the bedroom watching tv"," while my parents were in the livingroom watching something different. I could hear a loud and annoying commercial playing on theirs. I also heard something else"," something I was used to but I would always notice it. It was the low steady sound of an approaching plane.

I have seen these from my house"," (right off Route 50) for years.... they are a very quiet airplane when they want to be as well"," so the lack of noise is by design. On a foggy night all you see is the bright headlight and landing gear compartment lights....very unusual looking. We are also host to most every Blimp in the Northeast as there is ample space to post a docking mast. Not unusual to see the Goodyear blimp as well as many other corporate blimps doing a stop-over. One of those blimps at a low altitude and the message board lit up with an animation will turn your head too. Just thought you might like to know the area a little. I think there IS something out there.. Dont get me wrong.... I just related to the descriptions provided and drew a conclusion based on MY experiance living in a flight pattern.((NUFORC Note:  No date indicated.

We had driven to a remote area Southwest of Odessa"," Texas to a place on the Caprock that was an excellent skywatching spot.  There are many radio"," and television transmitters strung for miles along this caprock.  We had driven to a spot where the line of towers was behind us by probably 5 miles at most.  We were in his small convertible sports car.....an old"," tiny mid-engine Porsche.........and we were sitting on the tops of our seats where they met with the frame of the car.  There was no back seat to this car"," and it was like a T-top.  I don&apos;t remember how long we had been watching the sky"," when one of us spotted what at first looked like it might be a satellite...........reminded me of a moving star.  No blinking or twinkling to speak of"," no changes in intensity.  We first noticed it in the northwest"," and it was moving slowly but steadily. across the sky towards the Southwest.  We became convinced it was a satellite within about 30 seconds"," and at this point"," it was in the center of our field of vision (almost due West).  If you think in terms of inches"," it was about 12 inches above the horizon at that point we came aware of another identical light moving from the Southeast along the same horizontal plane.  We both then began to scan the entire sky almost instinctively"," and immediately became aware that there were numerous lights coming from several directions"," including directly overhead .  I remember at this point I was extremely excited and we were both shouting expletives and I was saying over and over"," Whaat is going on"," now.............come on"," what the hell is happening and him saying Wait"," wait"," look over here and oh crap there&apos;s another one.  They finally had us convinced that they were going to collide and I remember how intense the feeling was that we were about to witness an explosion of! some ki nd...........but instead"," as they got closer to each other"," they slowed a bit"," all at the same rate"," and all stopped instantly"," where then you saw what was either six or eight spots of light in a circle"," equidistant from each other.  Then they began to flash independently but in an organized sequence that then gave an impression of an octagon or six-pointed star.  It was like if you drew dots on a piece of paper and then connected the dots so that the shape was revealed.  However","  It seemed that the area within the dots was not obscured.  You could see the night sky within the area formed by the dots.  After about maybe 30 seconds to a minute (I have never been sure about how much time went by) they stopped flashing"," one at a time"," as if each had to complete a sequence"," then they were gone for a couple of seconds"," then all lit up at once"," and began to increase in brightness"," and then began to glow red"," and then streaked off in all 6 or eight directions"," leaving trails that reminded me of meteors on fast-forward  but disappeared before traveling halfway across the sky.  As we sat there with our mouths hanging open"," I was crying in wonder more that fear.  About 10 seconds maybe"," after they disappeared"," we heard what sounded like a sonic boom and a flash that lit up the whole sky for a split second"," brightest at the horizon.  Only in retrospect can a say that the flash reminds me of what I have seen in films of nuclear bombs.......the first flash.  I can remember us jumping off the car and each lighting cigarettes and just standing there smoking and looking at the sky and not speaking"," me crying.

The higher one streaked away to the east the lower one to the west.  They moved at an incedible speed as each moved out of sight in opposite directions completely gone from our horizon"," our line of sight now totally unobscured for miles.  We agreed amoungst ourselves not to mention it for fear of ridicule from our peers but I&apos;ll never forget it.

About 3:45AM one morning I was awakened to a noise coming from my three-year-old son&apos;s room.  Eventhough there was a rain and electrical storm outside I could hear this noise"," like a clicking sound with some occasional high-pitched  gurgling.  Concerned that my son might be having some breathing problems I sat up in bed and directed my attention to the hallway where his door was.  It startled me that his door was closed"," as we had never closed his door in the past.  Again I heard the noise and even though I tried for a brief moment to wake my wife I could not rouse her.  Again and again I heard the noise and was quite terrified that someone possibly was in my son&apos;s room.  I quickly gathered my courage and went to my closet for my S&amp;W 45 caliber semi-automatic pistol.  I chambered a round and moved to my son&apos;s door putting my ear against the door.  Again I heard the sounds and burst into the room.  What I saw next will never leave me... something I think about several times every day since then.  The way my son&apos;s room was laid out was my son&apos;s little bed was to the left of the open door and a window was directly ahead.  Eventhough the light was off"," a moment after I burst in I looked directly into my son&apos;s bed as lightening illuminated the room. I could see my son setting up in bed facing a small alien creature as if they were playing or something.  Simultaneously I realized the window was open"," the screen was off and there was a larger alien creature somehow hovering just outside the window.  The rain was pouring into the open window and I have learned since then that the best way I could describe the creature is that it was a &quot;Grey&quot;.  I was petrified and could not move.  I could tell by it&apos;s movements that I startled the alien outside the window as much as it startled me.  The next thing I know"," I am laying on the floor looking up at the lightening painting the ceiling and realized that my entire backside is soaking wet"," the window open"," it was not raining and my son was sound asleep in his little bed. ! Later I found my 45 laying in the center of the dinning room table with the magazine removed and one bullet (the chambered round) missing.  I have not been able to reconcile this event to this date.  The window was certainly open"," the screen on the ground two floors below (we lived on the second floor) and the carpet was soaked.  In addition"," the missing bullet was never found.

Mystery solved Noises in sky just Lockheed flight tests  By DAVE HIRSCHMAN The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  The mystery of the twin booms that have startled people from Chattanooga to Huntsville since June has been solved. The culprits are new F/A-22 Raptor fighters and chase planes making supersonic test flights over the region. So far 17 of the futuristic jets have been built at Lockheed Martin&apos;s plant in Marietta"," and all must show they can break the sound barrier before being handed over to the Air Force. The only problem is that no one let folks in the flight path know the sonic booms were coming. When residents asked the military about the alarming noises"," every branch denied having any planes in the area. &quot;Each boom sounds like an explosion","&quot; said Jess Hornsby"," 61"," of Signal Mountain"," Tenn."," a Chattanooga suburb. He estimates he&apos;s heard 10 in the last three months. &quot;There&apos;s no rumbling like thunder. It&apos;s a loud crack that really rattles the windows. People here have been wondering what in the world was going on.&quot;  Hornsby"," a self-described aviation buff"," said he looked up the first time he heard the booms and saw two white contrails streaking overhead. Each F/A-22 is shadowed by an F-16 chase plane. U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) said the first time he heard the twin booms"," he thought a coal mine had exploded. &quot;I thought I was going to have a heart attack","&quot; Wamp said. &quot;It was such a high impact.&quot;  Greg Caires"," a spokesman at the Marietta plant"," said the planes typically fly about 40","000 feet on a route that takes them from Crossville"," Tenn."," to Scottsboro"," Ala. The planes cover the 110-mile route in about four minutes. The flights follow an existing FAA-approved &quot;supersonic corridor","&quot; so rules that prohibit breaking the sound barrier over the continental United States don&apos;t apply. Lockheed says it tries to minimize disruptions by avoiding Sunday flights and keeping the planes high. Caires says security rules prohibit the company from telling residents in advance when supersonic flights will take place. Caires and Randy Neville"," an F/A-22 test pilot and University of Tennessee grad"," traveled to Chattanooga and Huntsville last week to let residents know what the planes have been doing in the skies overhead -- and to expect more booms in the future. Lockheed is accelerating F/A-22 production and plans to build more than 300 of the fighters. Once residents learned the planes were on their side"," Caires said"," Lockheed got a warm reception. &quot;People are very supportive and think the supersonic flights are really cool","&quot; Caires said. &quot;I tell them to look to the southwest next time they hear the booms -- but they better look fast"," because the planes won&apos;t be there long.&quot;""}"

They were low in altitude (definitely lower than any plane would fly) and they were flying straight across in a slight arch.

Also"," the first sighting the green sphere w/ tail was heading away from LAX which making it North or North/East in direction if that means anything as the second sighting was also East with a slight North direction.

To our right there are also tall trees 60&apos;-70&apos; which partially block our view of the mountains to the W. &amp; N/W. Obviously at night up here it can be very dark and any unusual light(s) or lighting will immediately attract the eye. In both these incidents"," it should first be noted that even in full darkness"," the outlines of the trees on &quot;our&quot; shoreline"," on the islands"," and the outline of the distant  mountains are clearly visible against the sky are always visible"," unless of course it would be cloudy/misty. In both cases the nights were starry &amp; clear. First Incident:- (In the 80&apos;s). While standing outside leaning on the railing &amp; facing the lake talking &amp; having a smoke arpound 23:00"," suddenly from our left (from beyond the branches of the pine tree)"," an emerald green mini-ball of light suddenly just shot in a absolutely dead straight line across the lake on the &quot;near side&quot; of the two islands I just previously described as being ~1/4 mi. beyond the pine tree. I would say that the light was traveling downwards at maybe 2-3 degrees. It then disappeared behind the trees on the second island I just described"," but it did not re-appear over the water to the right of that island. It just disappeared. All this could not have taken more than 2-3 seconds. The part I find interesting"," is that this light was not up high in the sky"," but very low over the water. It had to be"," because it&apos;s line of travel was well below the outline of the trees on the two islands to our left. Therefore"," logically"," if it was below the island treeline"," that would have to mean that the light past between us and the islands. And since it was streaking downwards towards the right"," it could only have gone either into the lake at some point behind the other island"," or into the shoreline on the far side of the lake. Those latter two locations are out of our line of sight from the deck. My wife &amp; I just looked at each other in silence; we knew we&apos;d both seen what I described"," but at the time"," we figured"," &quot;Who the hell&apos;s gonna believe that.&quot; Come to think of it"," right now"," I&apos;m still trying to figure out why I&apos;ve even bothered sending this report. Really"," the best way I can describe the shape and brightness of this light"," would be to say it sort of resembled the appearance of Disney&apos;s &quot;Tinkerbell&quot; when she was very far in the distance; just a small brilliant laser-like light that seemed to have a hint of a faint halo but with no real space between the light and the halo  - and with just a bit of a shimmering effect to it. One other thing that might be worth mentioning"," is that the next day there were also reports in Montreal"," and on the South Shore of the St. Lawrence River of people having seen a shooting emerald green light in the sky. 2nd Incident:- Same setting as 1st incident"," only I was alone standing at the front door leading onto the deck at about 23:00. Suddenly"," this time from the right"," the same green light streaked across the lake in front of me and just disappeared in mid-flight; it just sort of &quot;winked out&quot; so-to-speak.  This time it appeared to run in a very horizontal plane as it streaked by and was only visible for 2-3 seconds. Again"," this light had to have past directly over the lake"," because I could see the light against the mountains in the background across the lake"," and since the mountains across the lake are about 250&apos;-300&apos; high"," I would guess the light must have passed by at ~ 100-200 ft. above the water. This time the light appeared to be closer to me; maybe 1/4-1/3 mi. away. Note:- the lake is only about 1/2 mi. wide at this point. So there ya have it - our visit from &quot;Whatever&quot;.((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Dates of both incidents are unknown.  PD))""}"
